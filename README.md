# Animated 3D Dollhouse 

Demo web implementation of a a "scrolling" [technique used by Apple](https://css-tricks.com/lets-make-one-of-those-fancy-scrolling-animations-used-on-apple-product-pages/) to showcase animations with good performance. It recreates a flipbook effect using exported sequences of images. I made the 3D house model in [Spline](https://spline.design/).
